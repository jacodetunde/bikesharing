# bikesharing
## Overview
In this analysis I use Pandas to perform ETL on the data and upload it on Tableau to create a set of visualization that shows the following:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
## Results
