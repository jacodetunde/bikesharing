# Data Visualization of Bikesharing data
## Project Objectives
To provide a useful insight about the demographic, length of time , location and preferences of the riders
## Methods Used
- Data Visualization
## Technologies
- Pandas, Jupyter
- Tableau
## Project Description
In this analysis, I use Pandas to perform ETL on the data and upload it on Tableau to create a set of visualization that shows the following:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
## Results
- Checked out for all riders: Mostly male Riders tends to check out for 4 to 5 hours than female counterpart. 
- Number of bike trips for all riders and gender for each hour of each day of the week: There are over Twenty thousands trips between 6am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm on Mondays,Tuesdays,Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Wednesdays seems to have less demand for bikesharing. While Sundays have moderate bikesharing demands.
- Number of bike trips for each type of users: The Male subscribers are the major users of the bike between 6am-7am and 5pm-7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.

## Summary
The primary users of bike-sharing are Male subscribers. This means NYC Citibike should focus on expanding its marketing strategies towards this demographics sector. The analysis also shows that the peak hour for the demand for the bike is 6 am to 8 pm, which means, NYC Citibike should schedule any maintenance towards 12 am-5 am to avoid the inability to meet up with the demand. The analysis also showed that Thursdays and Fridays are the preferable days for Male subscribers to ride; this means more bikes should be made available on those days.
### Challenge
Though the analysis indicate that Male subscribers are the primary users of NYC Citibikes, it does not give indepth insight into the job and lifestyle of these demography.
No data on price to predict demand for the bikesharing.
### Recommendation
- Additional data need to be collected on the occupation and lifestyle of the subscribers in order to predict potential customers and plan a marketing campaign that can attract such customers in Des Monies 
- Additional data is also needed on the marital status of the users, perhaps, it can give an insight into the lower demand from the female gender.
- Data on the price is needed to effectively predict elasticity of demand for bikesharing.
