# bikesharing
## Overview
In this analysis I use Pandas to perform ETL on the data and upload it on Tableau to create a set of visualization that shows the following:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
## Results
- Checked out for all riders: Mostly male Riders tends to check out for 4 to 5 hours than female counterpart. 
- Number of bike trips for all riders and gender for each hour of each day of the week: There are over Twenty thousands trips between 6am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm on Mondays,Tuesdays,Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Wednesdays seems to have less demand for bikesharing. While Sundays have moderate bikesharing demands.
